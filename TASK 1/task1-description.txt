This Java program is a simple Currency Converter that uses the ExchangeRate-API to fetch real-time exchange rates and convert currency amounts. The program prompts the user to input the source currency, target currency, and amount to be converted. It then retrieves the exchange rate via an API, calculates the converted amount, and displays the result.

Key Features:

Real-Time Exchange Rates: Fetches live exchange rates using the ExchangeRate-API.

User Input: Allows users to specify the source currency, target currency, and the amount to convert.

Error Handling: Manages API errors, invalid currency codes, and unexpected input gracefully.

Formatted Output: Displays the exchange rate and converted amount with proper formatting for clarity.

Java Libraries: Utilizes libraries such as org.json.JSONObject, BufferedReader, and HttpURLConnection for API interaction and JSON parsing.
